# Graph Visualize

The Graph Visualize is a web interface that allows user to create, edit, import and export graphs on a webpage.

## Key features:

- Visualize a graph, its vertices and edges.
- Traverse a graph with the available traversal options (DFS, BFS, A\*). This includes traversing step by step or traversing the whole graph at once.
- Edit the graph by adding and removing vertices and edges.
- Import a graph from a file and export the graph to a file.
