# Feedback on initial specifications

The interlaced writeups for these classes threw me off briefly, but you did a good job with them!

## `BitVector` class

Good specs.  I don't think you will need to consider endianness unless you go for a very unexpected implementation of the class (that I can't even think of right now...)

Since this class seeks to enable (and ideally optimize) Boolean logic operations, bitpacking probably DOES make the most sense.  It also allows you to most easily use the built-in bool operations on the underlying representation (for which, I recommend a `uint64_t`, but that's up to you).

Issues like thread safety should only be worried about if you do an advanced version of the class.


## `IndexSet` class

The `ConstructSpan` idea is interesting, but I'm not positive what you mean, since index sets might cover non-consecutive regions.  Are you thinking that it would effectively translate each index to make it seem consecutive?  That could certainly be an interesting (and potentially powerful) effect, but pretty tricky to implement.

Very thorough list of functions to be implemented here.  I wouldn't worry about efficiency in the initial version (unless you pick this class to be one of the ones you make a more complex version of).

Very well thought-through set of challenges that you will need to deal with here.


## Audited `string` class

It wasn't clear from your writeup which member functions you were planning to audit.  Start with a subset of the more straightforward ones; add additional options (and iterators) if you decide to make a more sophisticated version of this class.

Don't worry about detection taking time in debug mode.  I recommend that outside of debug mode you just have something (in the cse namespace) like `using string = std::string;` and leave it at that with a guarantee of no change in performance.

## `RichText` class

You seem to have this one under control.  (Which is good, since overall it's probably the toughest class you're working with)

Again, keep a simple interface at first, but this class in particular has a LOT of possible directions that you could go with it.  I recommend making good use of your `IndexSet` class here to track which sites have a given style.  

## `Assert` function/macro

(I shouldn't have called this on a class -- sorry about that!  But definitely a good C++ implementation project.)

Good catch on there being a new assert in c++26 -- I had missed that!  Definitely something to pull ideas from.

If you're interested in making a fancier version of this class, I can give pointers on having it automatically dissect expressions like `assert(x <= y)` so that it will be able to automatically print the values of both x and y on failure.

More generally, I think macros are probably still the right move her, but other options can be fine choices too and C++ is making that easier and easier.
