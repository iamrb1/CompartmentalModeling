## Overview

The Compartmental Modeling System is an interactive simulation tool designed to allow users to create and analyze compartment-based models. Users can define an arbitrary number of compartments and specify connections between them using fixed transfer rates or differential equations. The system enables simulation over time, providing insights into compartment states at any given point. This makes it applicable to real-world problems such as epidemiological models (SIR), ecological dynamics (Lotkaâ€“Volterra), pharmacokinetics, and more.
## Features
- **Compartment Creation**: Users can add an arbitrary number of compartments to the system.
- **Connections**: Define directional or bidirectional transfer of quantities between compartments with:
    - Constant transfer rates
    - Differential equations governing transfer dynamics
- **Simulation Execution**:
    - Set a total simulation time and step size.
    - Run simulations to observe how compartment states evolve over time.
    - Pause, resume, or step through the simulation manually.
- **State Inspection**:
    - View the state of any compartment at any point in time.
    - Observe values numerically and graphically.
- **Graphing and Visualization**:
    - Generate graphs of compartment values over time.
    - Compare multiple compartments on the same graph.
    - Export simulation data for further analysis.
## User Interface
### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- **Graphical Representation of Compartments**:
    - Display compartments as nodes with labeled names.
    - Arrows indicate connections and direction of transfer.
    - Bi-directional arrows for mutual exchange.
- **Interactive Editing**:
    - Drag-and-drop functionality to position compartments.
    - Selection-based configuration of compartment properties.
### Control Panel
- **Connection Editor**:
    - Select a start and end compartment.
    - Define the type of connection (influx, outflux, bidirectional).
    - Set transfer rates or define differential equations.
- **Simulation Controls**:
    - Adjust time step and simulation duration.
    - Play, pause, or step through the simulation.
- **Graphing Tools**:
    - Select compartments to compare over time.
    - Customize graph appearance and export data.
## Technical Considerations
- **Core Language**: The project will be fully implemented in C++.
- **Mathematical Computation Engine**: Use numerical integration methods (e.g., Runge-Kutta) for solving differential equations.
- **Graphics & UI**: GUI implementation using Qt, SFML, or SDL for visualization and interactivity. 
- **Data Storage & Export**: Save/load models and export simulation results in formats like CSV or JSON.
- **Multithreading**: Optimize performance for complex simulations using C++ threading.
## Use Cases
- **Epidemiology**: Simulating disease spread using SIR/SIS models.
- **Ecology**: Predator-prey relationships like Lotka-Volterra models.
- **Environmental Science**: Forest fire spreading models.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Drug absorption and elimination simulations.
## Future Enhancements
- **Stochastic Modeling**: Introduce randomness for more realistic simulations.
- **Multi-parameter Optimization**: Automated tuning of model parameters to fit empirical data.
- **Parallel Computing**: Improve performance using multi-core processing and GPU acceleration.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

This project aims to provide a powerful, flexible tool for scientists, researchers, and students to model and analyze complex dynamic systems efficiently using C++.
