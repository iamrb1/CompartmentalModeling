## Team Expectations: 



1. **Communication**: We agree to maintain open, respectful, and timely communication within our team. We will use Discord for our discussions.
2. **Meetings**: Regular team meetings will be held on Fridays. Attendance is mandatory unless a valid reason is provided in advance. Supplemental meetings can be held 7pm or later during weekdays or as scheduled on weekends.
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Any conflicts that arise will be addressed openly in the team setting. If a resolution still cannot be reached after a substantial good-faith attempt, we agree to consult the course instructors to help resolve the dispute.
4. **Feedback**: Constructive feedback is essential. We agree to provide it respectfully and receive it with an open mind.
5. **Work Distribution**: Work will be fairly divided, and each team member commits to completing their tasks by mutually agreed-upon deadlines.
6. **Re-Evaluation of Roles**: We acknowledge that the project’s needs may change, and different people may want experience in different roles. We are open to re-evaluating and adjusting roles as required. Specifically, we will reevaluate roles after major milestones in weeks 4, 6, 10, and 12, or at any point that two or more group members request it.
